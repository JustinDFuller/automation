# setup
Setup files for getting started on a new machine

I always end up running (And having to figure out) the same commands over and over each time I set up a new machine. Trying to maintain those commands here so I can run a single file and have my whole dev environment set up.

## Warning
Piping to bash can be dangerous. I wrote these scripts, so I trust them.

## Linux
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinDFuller/setup/master/ubuntu.sh | sudo bash
```

## Mac
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinDFuller/setup/master/macosx.sh | sudo bash
```
